### Top-Level Roadmap

*   **Phase 1: Core Hook Enhancement** - Upgrade the `usePeerConnection` hook with the logic and states required for automatic reconnection.
*   **Phase 2: UI Integration** - Update the receivers join page to reflect the new reconnection status to the user.
*   **Phase 3: Validation** - Conduct end-to-end testing to ensure the reconnection works seamlessly.

### Phase 1: Core Hook Enhancement

| Task Description | Target Files & Paths | Dependencies/Preconditions | Test Conditions | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Add "reconnecting" status** | `apps/nully/hooks/use-peer-connection.ts` | None | The `ConnectionStatus` type should be extended to include a `'reconnecting'` literal type. | Done |
| **2. Implement reconnection trigger** | `apps/nully/hooks/use-peer-connection.ts` | Task 1 completed | When a connection is closed, the hook's status should change to `'reconnecting'`, and it should start a timer to attempt reconnection. | Done |
| **3. Handle successful reconnection** | `apps/nully/hooks/use-peer-connection.ts` | Task 2 completed | Upon a successful reconnection, the retry timer must be cleared, and the status should change to `'connected'`. | Done |

### Phase 2: UI Integration

| Task Description | Target Files & Paths | Dependencies/Preconditions | Test Conditions | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **4. Update Join Page UI** | `apps/nully/app/[locale]/join/[peerId]/page.tsx` | Task 1 completed | The join page UI should display a "Reconnecting..." message or indicator when the connection status is `'reconnecting'`. | Done |

### Phase 3: Validation

| Task Description | Target Files & Paths | Dependencies/Preconditions | Test Conditions | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **5. Full Feature Validation** | `apps/nully/app/[locale]/join/[peerId]/page.tsx` <br> `apps/nully/app/[locale]/transfer/[peerId]/page.tsx` | All previous tasks completed | 1. Sender and Receiver connect successfully. <br> 2. Sender reloads their page. <br> 3. Receiver's page shows "Reconnecting...". <br> 4. Connection is restored automatically after a few seconds. <br> 5. A file can be successfully transferred after reconnection. | Done |
