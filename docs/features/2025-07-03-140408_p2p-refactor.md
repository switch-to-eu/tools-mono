# Game Plan: P2P Transfer Refactor (Stateless, URL-Based)

**Objective**: Refactor the P2P file transfer feature to use a shareable link with the initiator's `peerId` directly in the URL, eliminating the need for a server-side, in-memory room store. This approach simplifies the architecture by making the backend stateless for this feature.

**Key Decisions**:
- Connections are managed directly between peers using their PeerJS IDs.
- The initiator's `peerId` serves as the unique identifier in a shareable URL.
- No tRPC endpoints or server-side state are required for establishing connections.
- This refactor will create new routes and hooks, leaving the original P2P implementation untouched for a non-destructive migration.

## Phase 1: Core Frontend Logic

This phase develops the primary hook for managing the PeerJS connection.

### Tasks

**1.1: Create `usePeerConnection` Hook**
- **Status**: Done
- **Task Description**: Develop a new hook `usePeerConnection` that encapsulates PeerJS logic. It will be responsible for initializing the `peer` object, managing its lifecycle (open, close, error), handling incoming connections, and initiating outgoing connections. The hook will expose the `peer` object, the local `peerId`, and connection status.
- **Target Files**: `apps/nully/hooks/use-peer-connection.ts` (new file)
- **Dependencies**: None.
- **Test**: Create a test component that uses the hook. Verify it initializes PeerJS and receives a `peerId` from the PeerJS server.

---

## Phase 2: UI & Routing

This phase builds the new user-facing pages for initiating and joining a transfer.

### Tasks

**2.1: Create Sender Page**
- **Status**: Done
- **Task Description**: Create a new page at `/transfer` that acts as the starting point for the sender. This page will use the `usePeerConnection` hook to get a `peerId` and then display a shareable link (e.g., `/join/[peerId]`) for the receiver. It will also show the connection status and wait for the receiver to join.
- **Target Files**: `apps/nully/app/[locale]/transfer/page.tsx` (new version, replacing old content)
- **Dependencies**: Task 1.1.
- **Test**: Navigate to `/transfer`. The page should display a loading state while initializing the peer connection, then show a unique `peerId` and the corresponding shareable URL.

**2.2: Create Receiver Page**
- **Status**: Done
- **Task Description**: Create a new dynamic page at `/join/[peerId]` for the receiver. This page will extract the sender's `peerId` from the URL, initialize its own peer connection using the `usePeerConnection` hook, and automatically attempt to connect to the sender.
- **Target Files**: `apps/nully/app/[locale]/join/[peerId]/page.tsx` (new file)
- **Dependencies**: Task 1.1.
- **Test**: In one browser, open `/transfer`. Copy the generated URL. In a second browser, open the copied `/join/[peerId]` URL. Verify that the two clients connect successfully and that their connection status indicators update.

**2.3: Implement Shared UI Components**
- **Status**: Done
- **Task Description**: Create the necessary UI components for this new flow, including:
    - `ShareLinkCard`: A component to display the shareable URL with a "Copy" button.
    - `ConnectionStatusIndicator`: A component to show the current state of the PeerJS connection (e.g., "Initializing...", "Waiting for peer...", "Connected").
- **Target Files**:
    - `apps/nully/components/share-link-card.tsx` (new file)
    - `apps/nully/components/connection-status-indicator.tsx` (new file)
- **Dependencies**: None.
- **Test**: Integrate these components into the sender and receiver pages. Verify the share card copies the correct link and the status indicator reflects the connection state accurately during testing of task 2.2.

---

## Phase 3: Integration

This phase integrates the new stateless flow into the main application.

### Tasks

**3.1: Update Navigation and Homepage CTA**
- **Status**: Done
- **Task Description**: Update the main "Start Transfer" button on the homepage and any navigation links to point to the new `/transfer` page. This replaces the old flow entirely.
- **Target Files**:
    - `apps/nully/app/[locale]/layout.tsx` (modification, if nav link exists)
    - `apps/nully/app/[locale]/page.tsx` (modification)
- **Dependencies**: Task 2.1.
- **Test**: Click the updated buttons. Verify they navigate to the `/transfer` page, initiating the new P2P flow.
- **Note**: No changes were needed as the homepage links already pointed to `/transfer` and we replaced that page with our new implementation.

**3.2: Deprecate Old Routes and Hooks**
- **Task Description**: Once the new flow is verified and stable, mark the old P2P routes, components, and hooks for deletion or archive them. This includes the original `useP2P` hook and any pages that used it. For now, this task is a placeholder for future cleanup, and no action is required.

## Phase 4: Data Protocol and State Management

This phase focuses on defining a clear data protocol and extending our core hook to manage the state of file transfers, without handling the actual file I/O yet.

**4.1: Define a Typed Message Protocol**
- **Status**: Done
- **Task Description**: Define a set of TypeScript interfaces for all messages that will be sent between peers (e.g., `FileMetadata`, `FileRequest`, `FileChunk`, `TransferComplete`). This creates a clear, type-safe communication protocol.
- **Target Files**: `apps/nully/lib/interfaces.ts` (new content)
- **Dependencies**: None.
- **Test**: The TypeScript compiler should pass without errors after adding the new interfaces.

**4.2: Extend `usePeerConnection` for Message Handling**
- **Status**: Done
- **Task Description**: Modify the `usePeerConnection` hook. Add a generic `send(message)` function that serializes any message from our protocol into JSON before sending. Add a dedicated `onData(callback)` handler that deserializes incoming messages and passes them to the component layer. This centralizes the communication logic.
- **Target Files**: `apps/nully/hooks/use-peer-connection.ts` (modification)
- **Dependencies**: Task 4.1.
- **Test**: In a test component, use the hook to send a simple `{ type: 'GREETING', payload: 'hello' }` message and verify the other peer receives it correctly through the `onData` callback.

**4.3: Manage File State with `useFileTransfer` Hook**
- **Status**: Done
- **Task Description**: Create a new `useFileTransfer` hook that sits on top of `usePeerConnection`. It will manage the state of the file transfer process: the list of files staged by the sender and the list of files available to the receiver. It will expose methods like `stageFile(file)` and `requestFile(fileId)`.
- **Target Files**: `apps/nully/hooks/use-file-transfer.ts` (new file)
- **Dependencies**: Task 4.2.
- **Test**: In a test component, call `stageFile(file)` and verify the `useFileTransfer` hook correctly sends the `FileMetadata` message via the `usePeerConnection` hook.

---

### Phase 5: UI and File I/O Implementation

This phase builds the UI components and integrates the actual file reading (chunking) and writing (reassembly) logic.

**5.1: Implement `FileSender` UI Component**
- **Status**: Done
- **Task Description**: Create the `FileSender` component. It will use the `useFileTransfer` hook to allow users to select files from their device. It will display a list of staged files (e.g., `document.pdf - 4.5 MB`).
- **Target Files**: `apps/nully/components/file-sender.tsx` (new file)
- **Dependencies**: Task 4.3.
- **Test**: Add the component to the `/transfer` page. Select a file and verify it appears in the sender's UI and that the metadata is received by the receiver.

**5.2: Implement `FileReceiver` UI Component**
- **Status**: Done
- **Task Description**: Create the `FileReceiver` component. It will use `useFileTransfer` to get the list of available files and display them with a "Download" button for each.
- **Target Files**: `apps/nully/components/file-receiver.tsx` (new file)
- **Dependencies**: Task 4.3.
- **Test**: Add the component to the `/join/[peerId]` page. When the sender stages a file, verify it appears in the receiver's UI with a clickable download button.

**5.3: Implement File Chunking and Sending**
- **Status**: Done
- **Task Description**: Enhance the `useFileTransfer` hook. When it receives a `FileRequest` message, it will read the corresponding file from the staged list, slice it into chunks (e.g., 64KB), and send each chunk as a `FileChunk` message using the `usePeerConnection` hook.
- **Target Files**: `apps/nully/hooks/use-file-transfer.ts` (modification)
- **Dependencies**: Task 4.3.
- **Test**: Click the "Download" button on the receiver's UI. Verify that the sender starts sending `FileChunk` messages and that they are logged in the receiver's console.

**5.4: Implement File Reassembly and Download**
- **Status**: Done
- **Task Description**: Finalize the `useFileTransfer` hook. It will listen for `FileChunk` messages, collect them in memory, and reassemble them into a `Blob`. Once the final chunk is received, it will generate an object URL from the blob and trigger a browser download.
- **Target Files**: `apps/nully/hooks/use-file-transfer.ts` (modification)
- **Dependencies**: Task 5.3.
- **Test**: Perform an end-to-end test. Send a file from the sender, click "Download" on the receiver, and confirm the file is downloaded correctly and is not corrupted.

## Implementation Notes & Debugging Insights

### Key Fixes Applied

**1. Locale URL Generation Issue**
- **Problem**: Generated shareable URLs were missing the locale parameter (`/join/[peerId]` instead of `/[locale]/join/[peerId]`)
- **Solution**: Added `useParams()` to extract locale and include it in URL generation
- **Code**: `return \`\${window.location.origin}/\${locale}/join/\${peerId}\`;`

**2. Connection Status UI Issue**
- **Problem**: PeerJS connection was working correctly (logs showed successful connection) but sender UI still displayed "Waiting for receiver to join..."
- **Root Cause**: Transfer page wasn't handling the "connected" status properly in the UI
- **Solution**: Added conditional rendering to show connected state when `status === "connected"`
- **Learning**: Always verify that UI state properly reflects the underlying connection state

### Debugging Strategy Used

**Comprehensive Logging**: Added detailed console logging to:
- `usePeerConnection` hook: peer initialization, incoming/outgoing connections, errors
- Transfer page: status and peer ID changes
- Join page: connection attempts and status updates

**Log Pattern**: Used prefixed logs like `[usePeerConnection]`, `[TransferPage]`, `[JoinPage]` for easy filtering

### Connection Flow Verified

1. **Sender**: Initializes peer → Gets peer ID → Displays shareable URL → Waits for connection
2. **Receiver**: Extracts sender peer ID from URL → Initializes own peer → Connects to sender
3. **Both sides**: Show connected status when connection is established

### Technical Notes

- PeerJS connections are bidirectional but asymmetric (one side initiates, other receives)
- The sender receives an "incoming connection" event when receiver connects
- The receiver gets an "outgoing connection opened" event when successfully connected
- Both events properly trigger status updates to "connected"
